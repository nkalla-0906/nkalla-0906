- 👋 Hi, I’m @nkalla-0906
- 👀 I’m interested in digging deeper in the world around me through data. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data analytics with Upgrad and Datacamp.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on beginner level projects and hopefully pretty soon it'll be intermediate projects :)
- 📫 How to reach me - email niveditakalla9@gmail.com
- 🌻 In my "day job" I work with students in optimising their college applications - increasingly using data.
- ✨ I am also a newbie yogini who is hoping to progress in my yoga and meditation practise in the time to come. 
- ☀️Talk to me about dogs, movies, yoga, fitness, K-Dramas, fitness, books, meditation, service design and ofcourse just about anything ... for I am deeply curious.
